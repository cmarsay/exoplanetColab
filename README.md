# exoplanetColab
This project uses a DCGAN and StyleGAN2 to generate new syhsntheitc images of planets using a dataset of mars and earth images. The project is meant to help with better understanding of planets and how differenmt planets form under different conditions. This project was made as part of  A.I. for Creative Technologies module that is a part of the final year of Digital Media. 

Dependecies:

Project was trained on version 1.10.0 or higher of tensorflow.
Projected used StyleGAN2 and DCGAN pytorch libraries.
Google Colab was used as interface to run pytorch libraries.
Suitable dataset collection moethods were implemented using Image Downloader and Photoshop batch tool.
