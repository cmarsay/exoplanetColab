# exoplanetColab
This project uses a DCGAN and StyleGAN2 to generate new synthetic images of planets using a dataset of mars and earth images. The project is meant to help with better understanding of planets and how different planets form under different conditions. This project was made as part of  A.I. for Creative Technologies module that is a part of the final year of Digital Media at the University of The West of England.

Dependencies:

Project was trained on version 1.10.0 or higher of tensorflow.
The Project used StyleGAN2 and DCGAN pytorch libraries.
Google Colab was used as an interface to run pytorch libraries.
Suitable dataset collection methods were implemented using Image Downloader and Photoshop batch tool.
